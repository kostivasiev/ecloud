## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of the 1 pager is to define the project, in order to form the basis for its management and an assessment of its overall success. The 1 pager gives the direction and scope of the project and (along with the Stage Plan) forms the 'contract' between the Project Manager and the Project Board.

The three primary uses of the 1 pager are to:

- Ensure that the project has a sound basis before asking the Project Board to make any major commitment to the project

- Act as a base document against which the Project Board and Project Manager can assess progress, issues and ongoing viability questions

- Provide a single source of reference about the project so that people joining the 'temporary organization' can quickly and easily find out what the project is about, and how it is being managed.
