Project Board on projects
===============================

The Project Board is accountable to senior UKFast management for the success of the project, and has the authority to direct the project within the remit set by senior UKFast management as outlined in the project mandate. With smaller projects this can just be the Sponsor but dependent on product(s) being developed you may need a Product Manager/Supplier.

The Project Board is also responsible for the communications between the project management team and stakeholders external to that team (e.g. senior UKFast Management).

SPONSOR
=======

The Sponsor is ultimately responsible for the project, supported by the Product Manager and Lead Engineer. The Sponsor's role is to ensure that the project is focused throughout its life on achieving its objectives and delivering a product that will achieve the forecast benefits. The Sponsor has to ensure that the project gives value for money, ensuring a cost-conscious approach to the project, balancing the demands of the business, user and supplier.

Throughout the project, the Sponsor is responsible for the Business Case.

The Project Board is not a democracy controlled by votes. The Sponsor is the ultimate decision maker and is supported in the decision making by the Product Manager and Lead Engineer.

Responsibilities
----------------

In addition to the Project Board's collective responsibilities, the Sponsor will:

- Oversee the development of the Business Case

- Secure the funding for the project

- Hold the Product Manager to account for realising the benefits defined in the Business Case, ensuring that benefits reviews take place to monitor the extent to which the Business Case benefits are achieved

- Transfer responsibility for post---project benefits reviews to senior UKFast management

- Escalate issues and risks to senior UKFast management if project tolerance is forecast to be exceeded

- Ensure that risks associated with the Business Case are identified, assessed and controlled

- Make decisions on escalated issues, with particular focus on continued business justification

- Ensure overall business assurance of the project -- i.e. ensuring we deliver what we say we would at the start

PRODUCT MANAGER
===============

The Product Manager is responsible for specifying the needs of those who will use the project's products, for user liaison with the project management team, and for monitoring that the solution will meet those needs within the constraints of the Business Case in terms of quality, functionality and ease of use. There can be more than one Product Manager.

The role represents the interests of all those who will use the project's products (including operations and maintenance), those for whom the products will achieve an objective or those who will use the products to deliver benefits. The Product Manager role commits user resources and monitors products against requirements. This role may require more than one person to cover all the user interests. For the sake of effectiveness, the role should not be split between too many people.

The Product Manager(s) specifies the benefits and is held to account by demonstrating to corporate or programme management that the forecast benefits which were the basis of project approval have in fact been realised. This is likely to involve a commitment beyond the end of the life of the project.

Responsibilities
----------------

In addition to the Project Board's collective responsibilities, the Product Manager(s) will:

- Provide the customer's quality expectations and define acceptance criteria for the project

- Ensure that the desired outcome of the project is specified

- Ensure that the project produces products that will deliver the desired outcomes, and meet user requirements

- Ensure that the expected benefits (derived from the project's outcomes) are realised

- Provide a statement of actual versus forecast benefits at the benefits reviews

- Resolve user requirements and priority conflicts

- Ensure that any user resources required for the project (e.g. to undertake user quality inspections and product approval) are made available

- Make decisions on escalated issues, with particular focus on safeguarding the expected benefits

- Brief and advise user management on all matters concerning the project

- Maintain business performance stability during transition from the project to business as usual

- Provide the user view on follow-on action recommendations

- Undertake UAT and, where appropriate, delegate UAT activitiesss

LEAD ENGINEER
=============

The Lead Engineer represents the interests of those designing, developing, facilitating, procuring and implementing the project's products. This role is accountable for the quality of products delivered by the supplier(s) and is responsible for the technical integrity of the project. There may be more than one Lead Engineer representing multiple suppliers to the project. Each supplier may have more than one representative to encompass multiple specialisms for the project's products (or appropriate subject specialists called in when required).

Depending on the particular customer/supplier environment, the customer may also wish to appoint an independent person or group to carry out assurance on the supplier's products (for example, if the relationship between the customer and supplier is a commercial one).

Responsibilities
----------------

In addition to the Project Board's collective responsibilities, the Lead Engineer will:

- Ensure that proposals for designing and developing the products are realistic

- Advise on the selection of design, development and acceptance methods

- Ensure that the supplier resources required for the project are made available

- Resolve supplier requirements and priority conflicts
